    "You cannot directly modify a column to change its data type from VARCHAR to INTEGER in SQL. The data type of a column is determined when the table is created and cannot be changed without altering the table structure.\n\nHowever, if you want to convert the text data in the \"name\" column to a numerical value, you can create a new column with the desired data type and populate it with the desired values. Here's an example:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE new_hotels AS\nSELECT id, \n       FLOOR(LENGTH(name) / 2) AS new_name,\n       hotel_url, \n       country, \n       state, \n       city, \n       address, \n       rating, \n       review_count, \n       stars, \n       description, \n       lat, \n       lon, \n       spa, \n       fitness_center, \n       pool, \n       parking, \n       wifi, \n       bar, \n       cribs, \n       restaurant, \n       aircondition, \n       airport_shuttle, \n       washing_and_drier, \n       ev_charging_station, \n       ocean_view, \n       pet_friendly, \n       casino, \n       kitchen, \n       water_park, \n       beach_access, \n       golf, \n       adults_only, \n       kids_friendly_buffet, \n       child_pool, \n       playground, \n       increased_accessibility, \n       unit_wheelchair_accessible\nFROM hotels;\n",

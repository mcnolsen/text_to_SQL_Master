    "A timeout occurredassistant\n\nNiccolo: We are a family from spain with two children looking to drive to portugal, so we need a hotel. Our car is electric, and we would prefer a hotel that accomodates children who likes to swim, that is relatively cheap.\n\nAIM: We divide the question into sub elements, and match them to known SQL columns or functions. They want to travel to Portugal, so: country = 'PT'. Driving and car is electric, so: ev_charging_station = 1. Children who likes to swim, so: pool = 1 OR beach_access IN ('private beach', 'beach access') OR child_pool = 1. Relatively cheap: stars <= 3. Therefore, the SQL statement answer is: SELECT * FROM hotels WHERE country = 'PT' AND (pool = 1 OR beach_access IN ('private beach', 'beach access') OR child_pool = 1) AND ev_charging_station = 1 AND stars <= 3;",

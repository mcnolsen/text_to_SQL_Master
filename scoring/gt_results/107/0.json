        "description": "The Waldhotel Schatten has a rich and exciting history, dating back to 1783. It became famous far beyond the region for an attraction that raised the pulse of all racing fans: The Solitude racetrack, with an S bend right in front of the hotel that was nothing short of notorious. Today the Waldhotel offers the perfect setting for a pit stop la relexa: peaceful, comfortable and relaxing. Even as you enter the lobby you will be welcomed by a synthesis of the traditional and modern, which is continued throughout the hotel. Our 138 rooms, including 12 suites, have been individually designed with an eye for pleasing details. No two rooms are alike, but all rooms naturally offer bath or shower/WC, hairdryer, TV, radio and minibar as standard features. We also have non-smoking rooms for our guests, on request.iHotelier/iStay",

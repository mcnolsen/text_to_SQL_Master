With its French-influenced design and architecture, the hotel consists of three buildings set in the most sophisticated private gardens in Madrid, with fountains and terraces shaded by ancient chestnut trees. The guest rooms are full of special details and historical references that immerse you in the past. Each public room is unique: The Red Room reflects pure French Classicism, while the oriental pieces in the Chinese Lounge recall the objects the Duke used to collect on his travels. The Wine Bar offers an extensive list of wines and small dishes, while the main restaurant, housed in the Duke's former Library, offers a level of cuisine commensurate with its palatial setting. Music, fresh flowers, arts and crafts, and highly attentive service from the household staff round off the unique experience of staying in a palace.Marriott",

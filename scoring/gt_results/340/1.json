        "description": "Located just 500 metres from the beach of Agios Ioannis in Mykonos, Katikies Mykonos is a 5-star boutique hotel featuring a selection of fine dining options, 2 infinity pools, a spa centre and a gym. Blending Cycladic style with modern elements, the hotel offers elegantly decorated rooms and suites with unobstructed sea view.

The modern bathrooms are fitted with hairdryer, bathrobes, slippers and free toiletries. Room service is available 24/7.

A fashion boutique with Greek and international designers and brands is also featured on site. Dining options include Botrini's Mykonos restaurant. After the amazing success of Botrini\u2019s Santorini in the emblematic Katikies Santorini Hotel, the island of Mykonos will be boasting its very own Botrini\u2019s Restaurant in the stunning premises of Katikies Mykonos Hotel. Botrini\u2019s Mykonos stays true to all the values that earned Botrini\u2019s its multiple awards and of course its Michelin-star, but in a most mesmerising Cycladic setting with the eternal blue of the Aegean Sea serving as the ideal background. In a truly magical ambiance and in front of the infinity pool seamlessly blending in with the sea and the sky, guests sample the eye-catching dishes of renowned Greek-Italian chef Ettore Botrini. Here the freshest and finest gifts of the sea and the land find their way into the chef\u2019s kitchen to be transformed into refined pieces of contemporary culinary art. At the Lower Deck Lounge, where the whitewashed background is disturbed only by the blooming bougainvilleas, that is where you can spend a full day dedicated to the indulgence of your palate and the relaxation of your mind. The glorious Greek sun reflects its beams on the iconic whitewashed setting of the Upper Deck Lounge and the view of the infinity pool almost becoming one with the azure waters of the Aegean Sea where you can take your pick from the tempting choices of the exciting all-day menu, based on Greek flavours but with a creative international touch. Finally, Fleur de Miraval's ultra-chic Champagne Bar awaits to become your personal haven of elegance and exquisite tastes.",

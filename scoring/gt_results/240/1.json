She dreamed of the twin palaces to greet those who enter the bridge as a graceful lady. Renowned architects Korb and Giergl, named after projects like Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music, envisioned of neo-baroque palaces that would serve as the gateway to the Elisabeth bridge. The palace is listed as a UNESCO world heritage site and is under monumental protection. Today, the hotel is committed to inspiring guests with its rich history, culture and epicurean excellence.

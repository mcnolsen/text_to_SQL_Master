        "description": "Oaxaca is one of the most visited places in Mexico thanks to its cultural and architectural treasures. The city, founded in 1529 will captivate you with its colonial buildings and green quarry precincts. Here you will find City Centro by Marriott Oaxaca. We offer you a new experience that stimulates the senses, reinventing the way of staying in a hotel. Famous for its religious architecture, Oaxaca is full of churches and convents that enclose the colonial history of Mexico and has more than a thousand historical monuments that reflect the evolution of the city. The most important are the Metropolitan Cathedral and the ex-Convent of Santo Domingo, that it contains inside the Museum of Cultures, the Fray Francisco de Burgoa Library and the Ethnobotanical Garden. If you like pre-Hispanic art and culture, we recommend an excursion to one of its archaeological spots, such as Monte Alban or Ocotlan or visit Hierve El Agua, a natural place whose attractions are fossilized waterfalls.Marriott",

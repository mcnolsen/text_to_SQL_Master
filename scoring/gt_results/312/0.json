The iconic building is in every way representative of the XIX century, a period which has marked the spirit and culture of Lisbon. The hotel has 87 unique and comfortable rooms, of which ten are spacious suites including two signature top floor suites. The entrance was mapped to resemble the journey of Ivens and Capelo, two of greatest Portuguese explorers to unveil Africa back on the XIX century. The hotel holds three cinematic dining areas designed by L\u00e1zaro Rosa Violan who offer a journey through Italian cuisine, al fresco dining and a \"Barra\" area.Marriott",

It is located in the modern neighborhood of Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es, where the Expo was held in 1998, the main theme of which was the oceans. That is why the hotel is conceptually inspired by the wind rose, symbolized by an inner courtyard around which the wind blows, welcoming guests as if they were maritime travelers. These allusions to the sea can also be seen in its rooms, where dark woods and light tones intermingle with blue tones, with references to the most significant details of the capital of Lisbon. Designed to pamper your senses, the Eurostars Universal Lisboa is full of luxurious details and facilities, including an impressive swimming pool, a spa and gym area, meeting rooms and a restaurant where you can taste the best Portuguese cuisine. In addition, parking is available for your convenience. The accommodation offers 5-star accommodation with a sauna. There is an on-site snack bar and guests can also make use of the business area. Lisbon Oceanarium is 400 metres from Eurostars Universal Lisboa, while Miradouro da Senhora do Monte is 6 km away. The nearest airport is Humberto Delgado, 3 km from the hotel, and the property offers a paid airport shuttle service.",

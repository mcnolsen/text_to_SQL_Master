        "description": "Located on the southwest coast of Thailand nestled between the lush jungle and clear blue waters of the Andaman Sea, Wyndham Sea Pearl Resort Phuket is waiting for you. From secluded coves to busy shores - your paradise is just around the corner with more than 30 of the world's finest beaches to choose from! If outdoor adventure is calling, take a guided day tour and canoe through Phuket's secret lagoons and caves to see the limestone cliffs jutting vertically through the water. Defy gravity by ziplining through the jungle at nearby Flying Hanuman or hike half-way up the Kathu Waterfall to the drop pool and jump in for a swim! This resort offers a variety of rooms including hotel deluxe, one- and two-bedroom deluxe suites - both with and without pool access, private pool suites and carissa pool villa suites that comfortably sleep 2 to 4 guests. All suites feature a private balcony/terrace, coffee/tea maker and mini fridge, and most suites offer access to an outdoor spa tub. Choose a one-or two-bedroom suite or carissa pool villa for private bedrooms and separate living/dining areas with a sleeper sofa. Upgrade to a one- or two-bedroom deluxe with pool access for direct access to a shared pool and spa tub or choose the one-bedroom deluxe with pool or carissa pool villa for a private, infinity pool and kitchenette. Rollaway beds are available for an additional fee. Just five minutes from the resort is Patong Beach - a popular place to visit on the island and known for its exotic views, beachside activities, premier shopping and energetic nightlife. Just off the beach, Bangla Road is the liveliest place to explore with local eateries, bars, night clubs, live music, vendors and premier shopping. Remember to drink plenty of water and keep the local phrase 'mai pen rai' in mind, meaning \"it doesn't matter\" because while in Phuket, there is simply no room for worry.iHotelier/iStay",

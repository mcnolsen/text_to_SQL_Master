The city was built where the ancient city of Halicarnassus of Caria once stood. The ancient town was also home of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, on e of seven ancient wonders of the world. From this impressive structure the term mausoleum derived from, which is now commonly used to refer to any grand tomb. Halicarnassus was also a city which Alexander the Great laid siege to in 334 BC and where in the 1400s the Knights Hospitaliers built Bodrum Castle with rocks from the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. Bodrum is thus a fascinating city for any admirer of ancient history and for travellers who enjoy excursions amongst ancient ruins.iHotelier/iStay",

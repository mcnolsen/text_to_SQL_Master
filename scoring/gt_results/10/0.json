The journey of Saga Hotels first began in Frogner, where Saga Hotel Oslo, BW Premier Collection was established. This beautiful setting, rich in heritage, and surrounded by the quaint architecture of Majorstuen was a prosperous beginning to what would eventually expand the family into three new concepts throughout Oslo. Each individual concept focuses on attracting various types of travelers whilst catering to their everyday needs and desires.

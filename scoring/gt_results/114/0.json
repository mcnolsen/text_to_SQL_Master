Guests also enjoy high-end amenities without sacrificing environmentally friendly practices, while the restaurants offer the best cuisine in the region, extensive plant-based options, and impeccable style. But even still, the real jewels are the Architects of Life personal growth program and the Rituals of Sound series. The Hotel is Pet Friendly, for more information contact the hotel.FarePortal",

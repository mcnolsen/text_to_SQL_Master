Benniksgaard takes its name from a family farm dating all the way back to 1393. Today, Benniksgaard is privately owned and run as a hotel. All the buildings have undergone a comprehensive and painstaking renovation. The rustic style, exposed beams and bright colours create an airy, inviting atmosphere. The old chicken house has been transformed into Restaurant Pejsestuen, the longest wing into a hotel wing with 31 rooms \u2013 and the old farmhouse from 1782 into fourteen stunning spacious rooms and suites. With its squinting walls, sash windows and creaking floors, the listed farmhouse is a constant reminder of bygone times. The first floor staircase is a particularly interesting relic, and indeed, its narrow steps have been a constant feature of the farmhouse. The old grain stores and a recently added wing are home to several function and conference rooms, while the wing formerly occupied by agricultural machinery now houses BenniksgaardButik shop, offering a wide range of items to suit all tastes.bestwestern.com",

Some of its walls are 1.2 to 1.5 metres thick. The wood panelling, creaking floorboards, low ceilings, narrow staircases and thick wooden beams create a cosy atmosphere. Black Jack's is a separate part of the inn and is located in a courtyard to the rear. Eight of these 10 spacious rooms have mini kitchens and a small seating area. The Black Tower is a listed Edwardian building locate towards the rear of the inn in a separate building. It is a few minutes' walk from Caernarfon Castle.",

        "description": "Fig Tree Farm Cottage B&B is located on 5.5 acres in picturesque Highvale. We are located only 7 minutes from popular Samford village. The cottage has outstanding mountain views and a variety of friendly animals to hand feed. Come and unwind and make some awesome family memories. A country breakfast is provided for every day of your stay! The cottage is new and has a large patio, ducted aircon, 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom + 1 ensuite, a full kitchen and laundry. Wifi is complimentary and we have a TV with Netflix. The cottage is perfect for staying in if you are attending a nearby wedding, or just need a relaxing country escape! Recommended for children 3yrs+. Our 4 resident hand-reared goats (including 2 pygmy goats) are extremely friendly and love a cuddle, to be handfed and brushed! New to the farm are 2 bottle fed lambs that guests are also welcome to feed and brush! We offer 'guinea pig encounters'. We have 3 adult guinea pigs and 1 baby guinea pig. Guinea pig interactions will always be introduced by the host as they are cared for as part of the Fig Tree Farm family. We also have a newly built 'Chick Inn' with 15 chickens so you can collect farm fresh eggs in a basket to cook yourself! Periodically we also hatch chicks! We live on the property and care for the animals continually thorough out the day, so all the animals will be introduced personally and any special instructions will be given on arrival. Fig Tree farm Cottage does not welcome outside dogs as we have farm animals to care for on the property. The patio is perfect for escaping the hustle and bustle of busy lives, while sitting and enjoying a wine or coffee. The cottage patio is not overlooked by the main house so it feels very private. Two of the 3 bedrooms have mountain and paddock views. The master bedroom boasts an en-suite with a large shower. The cottage has outstanding mountain views and a feeling of country charm. The entire cottage is fully air-conditioned and is tastefully decorated. There are a large variety of indoor and outdoor games available to keep children and adults alike entertained! These include obit tennis, badminton, volleyball, giant lawn bowling, a cricket set, cards, board games, car sets, dinosaurs, a tea set, interactive activity books, children books and puzzles etc. To make the cottage even more accessible to people with mobility issues we have added removable door ramps, a removable shower lip ramp, 2 types of shower chairs (one with arms and a back and a wheelchair friendly transferable seat), a removable toilet surround safety rail to aid standing up, a non slip shower mat, a chair protector, mattress protectors and a bed assist frame to aid getting out of bed. Guests can access most of the bottom section of the property including the paddocks, seasonal creek, pine forest that overlooks the local cricket pitch, chicken coop, lamb paddock, orchard and goat enclosure. We have recently added a 'share garden' in self wicking vegetable beds so guests can pick fresh herbs, lettuces and more to eat during their stay! I will be available as required during the hours of 8am-5pm by phone and in person when I feed the animals. Additionally I will be contactable between 5pm till 8am via text. We live on site as it is our family home and we care throughout the day for the animals that are located near the cottage. Samford village is just 7 minutes away by car to visit the swings at the park, or have an icecream. If you fancy eating out there are plenty of highly regarded venues to choose from. There are coffee shops and cafes located in the village as well as fine dining venues available. Pause and The Little Tree Bakery and Brewhouse, to mention 2, come highly recommended. If you would like to explore the surrounding area for a day trip we are close to Mt Glorious, Dayboro and the popular Cedar Creek Falls. Travena Glen farm is nearby for a day out to take the kids horse riding and Lyell Deer Sanctuary has friendly deer to hand feed! Harry Potter fans will be delighted by the Harry Potter shop called 'The Store of requirement' and is located within Samford village.

        "description": "Our passion is sharing this magnificent place, the Sea of Cortez, with our friends, old and new. We invite one and all to come, explore and enjoy what Jacques Cousteau called \u201cthe world\u2019s aquarium\u201d. \u201cJersey Girl\u201d is one of the largest, best equipped and most comfortable yachts available for charter in the Sea of Cortez. We truly enjoy sharing this amazing place, and our past guests agree, there is no better way to experience it than on the water onboard Jersey Girl. Come let us sail you away to some of the most beautiful and tranquil beaches and bays anywhere on earth. Often, we are accompanied by playful pods of dolphins, rays jumping for joy and breaching whales are a common site. Jersey Girl is a very modern, well equipped and extremely comfortable vessel. Our four private staterooms each feature private head and shower. The spacious salon features seating for ten, big screen video, a wet bar with ice maker and espresso machine and of course a blender for the perfect margarita. Our spacious decks are the perfect place to catch the rays or the cool breezes, and we have much more space than any catamaran or power yachts our size. Enjoy our unique bean bags, deck chairs, or lounge on the large padded area ahead of the cockpit. Our cockpit features seating, fold up table of cocktails and snacks, or an al fresco dinner. There is plenty of shade for the sunny days of summer. If being wet brings happiness, Jersey Girl has it covered. We have snorkeling equipment, and a marine biologist on board to guide and help identify what is seen. Stand up paddle boards, and even a crystal clear kayak. Our twenty foot by eight foot floating island is one of our more popular toys. Jersey Girl fifteen foot Zodiac tender is powerful enough to go tubing, and make excursions to beaches, reefs, and nearby islands. We often find unique and untouched snorkeling spots, where our guests can be alone with the local inhabitants. If SCUBA is your passion, we operate in conjunction with the premier dive center in Baja, Cortez Expirations, and we can arrange guides, instructors, equipment rentals, and we have a dive compressor on board. Of course no trip to La Paz is complete without swimming with whale sharks, and swimming with the sea lions. Although there are additional costs involved, it is truly a once in a lifetime experience. We are licensed, insured, and permitted in accordance with Mexican law. We are a legal charter operated to the highest standards. Customer service and safety is our highest priority. We look forward to meeting new friends.VRBO",

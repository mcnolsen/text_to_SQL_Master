The beaches of La Paz are famous for their beautiful blue waters and white sand. Tecolte and Balandra are two popular beaches, where locals and tourists swim, sun and soak up the natural beauty.If you're in La Paz in February, don't miss the Gray Whale Festival. Take a guided excursion to the Ojo de Liebre lagoon, where you can see the giant whales migrate through Baja California Sur. There's no better place to get up close to the action to see these amazing creatures.For the best that downtown has to offer, visit Velasco Garden in the city's main square. It's a hub of activity and a great place to relax, visit nearby cafes and people watch after a long day of meetings. If you have time, stop by the Catedral de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Paz, a cathedral constructed in the late 19th Century, that houses dozens of works of art rescued from old missions.Marriott",

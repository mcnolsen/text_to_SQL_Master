The hotel offers the key to Istanbul\u2019s happening Karak\u00f6y neighborhood, where hip art galleries and restaurants brush shoulders with local fish markets on the banks of the Bosphorus. The interiors, designed by Sinan Kafadar, breathe life into the grand, marble structure with eclectic pops of color, rich jewel tones, and abstract art. With sweeping views of the Bosphorus and the historic city behind it, one\u2019s eye is often drawn to the scene outside the oversized windows.Marriott",

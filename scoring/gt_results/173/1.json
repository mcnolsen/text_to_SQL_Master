If you're feeling adventurous, take a trip to one of our underground lakes (cenotes). Go scuba diving or snorkelling in crystal clear water and see the colourful sea creatures that live just below the surface.

        "description": "Mexico City is one of the most vibrant and attractive destinations in our country. Being full of contrasts, culture and gastronomic delights, visitors can enjoy it in different ways. In the south of the city, within a colony characterized by its historical wealth, is City Express by Marriott CDMX Tlalpan.On the other hand, if you have free time between your work commitments, we recommend you take advantage of our privileged location to go for a walk and discover some of the many charms that the CDMX houses a few minutes away. Coyoacn is one of the most visited areas and preferred by tourists, thanks to its beautiful corners, gastronomic offer and immense number of museums. From its \"Zocalito\" to La Fuente de los Coyotes, the famous Coyoacn Market and the Frida Khalo Museum, these are some of the places you can't miss. On the other hand, if your stay is longer and you have the fortune of being in the football game season, going to Estadio Azteca to witness a classic will be a unique experience.Marriott",

        "description": "IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 2 BEDROOM, 2.5 BATHROOM UNIT, SEARCH VRBO FOR PROPERTY LISTING # 644945. $2,550.04/WEEK. THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR A ROMANTIC GETAWAY! If you are looking for a place to rediscover one another, you can not beat the FIESTA AMERICANA GRAND RESORT. Keep reading for all the details: The hot tub pictured here is located right on the ocean which makes for a very romantic atmosphere, day or night! Looking out over the ledge at the waves crashing below and beyond at the gorgeous Sea of Cortez evokes a very relaxing atmosphere. Especially once the sun goes when you think it can't get any better, if the moon is shining you will be in for a MOST ROMANTIC TREAT! With the moon shining on the ocean, a swath of romantic light shines right to the hot tub, illuminating the waves crashing on the rocks is a very special setting, perfect for creating lasting memories! During the day, the BEACH at THE FIESTA AMERICANA GRAND is one of the few beaches where YOU CAN ACTUALLY SWIM in the ocean. There are NO rip currents here! As beautiful as all the beaches on the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific Ocean are, it is not safe to swim and snorkel at many of the resort beaches. Here at the Fiesta Americana resort there are beautiful tide pools where it is totally safe to snorkel and view undersea life! The only exception would be if there is a storm out at sea generating large swells. Then, if the waves are too large, it is not safe to swim or snorkel. But, then you can easily go to two beautiful beaches that are in sheltered bays where you can still swim and snorkel. They are both only minutes away by car in the same direction, along Highway 1, (the main highway). There are signs on the highway making it easy to find them, PLAYA SANTA MARIA and CHILENO BAY. 'Playa' is the Spanish word for 'beach'. If the waves at Fiesta Americana are large be sure to go to the hot tub (pictured in the photo gallery) and hang over the ledge looking out over the ocean. Watching the waves crashing on the rocks below is a wonderous sight to behold! The spray can go as high as ten feet in the air and you can witness the power of the ocean, at a safe distance, of course! All of the units at FIESTA AMERICANA GRAND have spectacular ocean views. Some of the units are in a building called Phase 1. Phase 1 is so close to the ocean that when you are inside your unit you can hear the waves crashing on the rocks right below your balcony! I always request a unit in Phase 1 because I love being as close to the ocean as possible. And if you request a unit in Phase 1 you could possibly experience sitting on your balcony being mesmerized by the waves crashing onto the rocks right below your balcony! Explore the beautifully landscaped resort grounds to see the many delightful settings inviting you to indulge your desires. Swim in one of three large swimming pools or in the Sea of Cortez. Lounge under a palapa on the beach. Relax in a swinging hammock. Eat and drink in a variety of restaurants and bars. All are just a few minutes stroll within the luscious tropical resort grounds. The beds and bedding are very comfortable. And everything is very clean! Housekeeping cleans the unit every day. The towels and linens are laundered every day. If you need anything just ask, they want you to be happy and have a good vacation, they will do their best to accomodate your every need, within reason. If you don't want to rent a car, you CAN spend your entire vacation at the resort and eat breakfast, lunch and dinner at the resort's restaraunts every day. The resort has several restaurants and bars, all of them serve excellent food and drinks. Be sure to eat dinner at the enchanting Peninsula Restaurant, right on the beach, at least once! There are servers that will be happy to bring refreshments and meals to you on the beach and poolside. Room service is also available 24/7. Based on my personal experience in the last ten years, the staff are super friendly and eager to please! They have a desire to make sure your vacation is enjoyable and they will bend over backwards to make sure you are happy! The resort is located on a beach that is not accessible to vendors, which means that it feels like you are on a 'private' beach. You can swim and snorkel most of the time. The only time it is not safe to swim at the resort's beach is when there is a storm out at sea creating large swells which come crashing onto the beach as large waves. Then it is not safe to swim, but it IS the perfect time to witness the awesome power of the ocean from a safe distance, as in from the ledge in the hot tub (pictured in the photo gallery) or from your private balcony if your unit is in Phase 1, the building built right on the rocks. Watching the waves crashing on the rocks below is a wonderous sight to behold! The spray can go as high as ten feet in the air! If you do rent a car, there is ample free parking for your rental car in a covered garage.VRBO",

The beaches of La Paz are famous for their beautiful blue waters and white sand. Tecolte and Balandra are two popular beaches, where locals and tourists swim, sun and soak up the natural beauty.If you're in La Paz in February, don't miss the Gray Whale Festival. Take a guided excursion to the Ojo de Liebre lagoon, where you can see the giant whales migrate through Baja California Sur. There's no better place to get up close to the action to see these amazing creatures.For the best that downtown has to offer, visit Velasco Garden in the city's main square. It's a hub of activity and a great place to relax, visit nearby cafes and people watch after a long day of meetings. If you have time, stop by the Catedral de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Paz, a cathedral constructed in the late 19th Century, that houses dozens of works of art rescued from old missions.Marriott",

        "description": "El Duque is the perfect platform for fun and adventure in the Sea of Cortez; a 53 ft converted trawler, she has 2 air conditioned cabins with 6 bunks and a bathroom in each - we can take a maximum of 12 but limit our trips to 10 for comfort. She is full of character, the original boat builder knew John 'The Duke' Wayne hence the name of the boat and some of her history. The bunk style accommodation will build camaraderie and lead to adventures on the high seas. There is a fully stocked galley and living area where you will enjoy a variety of home cooked meals and snacks throughout the day. We pride ourselves on catering to all of your dietary needs and requirements with a fabulous selection of Mexican and International fare. The living area also provides space to relax out of the sun and play a game of cards or perhaps watch a movie on the boat TV. She also comes equipped with fishing rods and kayaks for you to use in your spare time. We have a spacious sun deck which is great for relaxing with a book or perhaps having a BBQ and cocktail in the evening. You may even decide to bring your bedding up here to enjoy sleeping under the stars! The dive platform allows easy access in and out of the water and there is some space for your camera and electronics too. She carries all safety equipment as required under Mexican Law, including oxygen, life vests, and fire suppressants and we also have all permits necessary for the Natural Protected Areas that we visit. Setting us apart from most charter boats is our tender - no ore squeezing into a little dingy but rather we bring our panga on every trip to make shore excursions and activities quicker and easier; she has cushioned seats and protection from the sun. We organise charters out into the Sea of Cortez, mainly using the boat as our platform to explore Isla Espiritu Santo but also go further afield depending upon your timeframe. We can organise activities such as scuba diving, snorkelling, kayaking, beach exploration, hiking etc all from our boat - no need to hire outside dive companies with whom to rendezvous - do it from the comfort of our vessel. Your hosts, Norm and Cat are both PADI Scuba Instructors and can assist you with courses or try dive experiences if this is of interest to you. We personalise our charters depending on each group and what you would like to do. Please contact us for more information or to discuss your dream trip.VRBO",

The city, founded in 1529 will captivate you with its colonial buildings and green quarry precincts. Here you will find City Centro by Marriott Oaxaca. We offer you a new experience that stimulates the senses, reinventing the way of staying in a hotel. Famous for its religious architecture, Oaxaca is full of churches and convents that enclose the colonial history of Mexico and has more than a thousand historical monuments that reflect the evolution of the city. The most important are the Metropolitan Cathedral and the ex-Convent of Santo Domingo, that it contains inside the Museum of Cultures, the Fray Francisco de Burgoa Library and the Ethnobotanical Garden. If you like pre-Hispanic art and culture, we recommend an excursion to one of its archaeological spots, such as Monte Alban or Ocotlan or visit Hierve El Agua, a natural place whose attractions are fossilized waterfalls.Marriott",

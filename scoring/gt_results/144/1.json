        "description": "Soaking up the breeze, right bang smack on the sand, arms flung wide open to the Atlantic, this is JANEIRO. Located in the middle of Leblon's marvellous beach-culture, we bring Rio's bossa vibe to life. Nature is a joyful accomplice. And what about that view? The Cagarras islands scatter across a horizon blue as far as the eye can see. No make-believe needed here. At night, the Moon beams, and in the distance, the lights of Vidigal glitter and dance like fireflies. Pure poetry for the eyes, woven into the urban effervescence of the city. The barefoot simplicity of the beach finds its way into the smallest of details; from the rooms to the food, the music to the art, all is an extension of the golden sands out front. We sway to no other rhythm but Rio's.iHotelier/iStay",

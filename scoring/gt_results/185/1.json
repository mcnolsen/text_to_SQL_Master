The Vrbo calendar helps provide availability and estimated price quote. Always inquire with the agent and do not reserve airfare until your confirmation has been received. Any issues with resort service, accommodations, physical plant, amenities, etc. are the direct responsibility of the developer and must be handled through the resort, not Concierge Realty. Photos are thought to be truly representative of the resort and accommodations. Any variation from the photo and actual property are unintentional, so guests are encouraged to do their own due diligence prior to reserving. Any variance or disruption including but not limited to renovation, unavailable amenity, change in decor, etc. during the stay, whether announced prior to reservation, occurring during the stay or announced after confirmation, is a matter strictly between the guest and resort, are not deceptive advertising, breach of contract or the responsibility of Concierge Realty. Note that the images are representative of this villa and that a specific view type is not implied nor promised by virtue of the images. A specific view category must be addressed with rental agent. Concierge Realty reserved the right to reserve any view category unless one has been agreed upon in writing. The resort confirmation will show the view designation and the villa will be placed within that view category unless, in a rare instance the view will be noted as \"not guaranteed\" in which case the resort reserves the right to place the guest anywhere within the property. Issues regarding view within the guaranteed view category are to be addressed with the resort management as Concierge Realty is not responsible for villa placement. Please be advised that if a non-domestic credit card is used to reserve a vacation rental, additional fees may be incurred. All details are accurate to the best of our knowledge. Any questions with regard to view, amenities, bedding configuration, decor or other details should be addressed with Concierge Realty, Winter Garden, FL. Guests are encouraged to do their own due diligence to assure that the resort and villa will meet their expectations.VRBO",

We recommend a guided tour of the ruins in Chichen Itza, one of the largest Mayan ruins. Or soak up the sun on a boat ride to Isla Mujeres, a tropical island with white sandy beaches and massive coral reefs. If you're feeling adventurous, take a trip to one of our underground lakes (cenotes). Go scuba diving or snorkelling in crystal clear water and see the colourful sea creatures that live just below the surface. For a break from the heat, duck into Plaza Las Americas or Plaza La Peninsula and explore the shops and restaurants. And after the sun goes down, get ready to experience Cancun's exciting nightlife.Dance the night away at one of the most popular dance clubs Coco Bongo.Marriott",

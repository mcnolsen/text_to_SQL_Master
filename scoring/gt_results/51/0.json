        "description": "Nestled in Vienna, this 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom vacation home brings it all within your reach. Fans of nature and the outdoors will love being 12 minutes by foot from Wiener Prater and 15 minutes from Viennese City Park. Your feet will make short work of the 7-minute walk to Hundertwasser House Vienna or the 13-minute walk to Schwedenplatz. Check out other neighborhoods and see more of Vienna by hopping on a metro at either Landstrasse U-Bahn, a short 9-minute walk away, or Nestroyplatz U-Bahn, 11 minutes away. While you're here, you can enjoy all the comforts of home and more, including an oven and WiFi, as well as a TV and a balcony.VRBO",

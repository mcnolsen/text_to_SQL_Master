        "description": "When in Rome it is important to have good public transport links and a central location that lets you reach the main attractions on foot; therefore Hotel Galatea is ideal. Set on the corner of Via Nazionale you are right in the heart of one of the most popular shopping districts in Rome, a 10-minute walk from Termini Station. Each guest room boasts a modern design and comes with air conditioning. A sweet and savoury continental breakfast is served daily. Ask at reception about guided tours around Rome and airport transfers. The Galatea Hotel is close to the popular neighbourhood of Monti where you can find plenty of typical wine bars and restaurants. The Roman Forum and Coliseum are around 10 minutes away on foot. In addition, you are just a few hundred metres away from metro stops on both city lines; perfect for travelling further afield.",

With its 162 rooms and suites, design twist and vibrant experiences, the hotel marks the W Hotels entry to the scene in an unapologetically Italian way, starting from the taste experiences with Head chef Ciccio Sultano who shakes up the city's foodie scene with authentic Sicilian cooking served at Giano Restaurant. Loaded with Roman vitality yet dismantling the norm, W Rome has something for everyone, whether it be a sweet retreat at Zucchero x Fabrizio Fiorani, a cocktail with upbeat music at W Lounge or live entertainment at Giardino Clandestino. On the upper floor, striking views of the city make Seu Pizza con Vista, in collaboration with Pier Daniele Seu, and WET Deck even more exceptional. Owning the Eternal City mindset, W Rome calls out the past, present and future to remix tradition and defy boundaries.Marriott",

        "description": "At Kimpton Fitzroy London, we have stories galore to tell. From the outside, the palatial 19th-century landmark building, which occupies a full block in Bloomsbury, looks the part of grande dame. Inside are contemporary creature comforts like roomy, art-filled suites with views over Russell Square, and destinations restaurants and bars that'll take your breath away. Fitz's, a glamorous drinking den that keeps the cocktails flowing; Burr & Co; a casually cool coffee shop; the light-filled, foliage-adorned Palm Court; and Galvin Bar & Grill, a modern British restaurant by Michelin-starred brothers Chris and Jeff Galvin. All of these details beckon modern travelers to settle in, and stay a while.IHG Hotels & Resorts",

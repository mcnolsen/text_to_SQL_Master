        "description": "High above Oslo, with a view that takes your breath away, is Voksenasen. The hotel is surrounded by beautiful nature, with good public transport connections to Oslo's bustling cultural life. Our restaurant offers fresh Nordic ingredients. Parking is free. At Voksenasen, you can be sure that we do everything to make you as a guest feel well taken care of, regardless of whether you are here on behalf of work, as a wedding guest or as a tourist. Airy and bright common areas with art that invites to spontaneous conversations, good beds and inviting scents from the restaurant. From the center of Oslo, you can easily and conveniently get around by car and public transport. Love to ski and move in the woods and fields? Then Voksenasen is the place for you. With our location in Nordmarka, you reach within 5 minutes drive no less than three brilliant opportunities for outdoor activities; Tryvann, Holmenkollen and Nordmarka. In summer it may be appropriate with a glass of bubbles on the terrace or a round in the outdoor pool. Let yourself be tempted by our pizza and homemade ice cream that tastes best outside and in the company of good friends. Tryvann is home to Eastern Norway's largest alpine center. In the summer, the facility offers climbing for all ages and skill levels in the climbing park High & Low. Roseslottet sits at the top of Frognerseteren. For Voksenasen, as a hotel with a background in humanitarian aid during World War II, Roseslottet is close to our hearts and offers space and art. Holmenkollen offers good trails for both skiing and roller skiing and world-class sports experiences. Here is also the Ski Museum, with the opportunity to take the trip all the way up to the top of Holmenkollbakken. In summer, you can end the visit with a zipline trip in Kollensvevet. Nordmarka is the entire Oslo hiking area and offers mile after mile of well-groomed ski trails, well-marked hiking trails, bathing water and cabins for a waffle.bestwestern.com",

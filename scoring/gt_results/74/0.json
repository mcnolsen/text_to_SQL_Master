All the buildings have undergone a comprehensive and painstaking renovation. The rustic style, exposed beams and bright colours create an airy, inviting atmosphere. The old chicken house has been transformed into Restaurant Pejsestuen, the longest wing into a hotel wing with 31 rooms \u2013 and the old farmhouse from 1782 into fourteen stunning spacious rooms and suites. With its squinting walls, sash windows and creaking floors, the listed farmhouse is a constant reminder of bygone times. The first floor staircase is a particularly interesting relic, and indeed, its narrow steps have been a constant feature of the farmhouse. The old grain stores and a recently added wing are home to several function and conference rooms, while the wing formerly occupied by agricultural machinery now houses BenniksgaardButik shop, offering a wide range of items to suit all tastes.bestwestern.com",

We offer you a new experience that stimulates the senses, reinventing the way of staying in a hotel. Famous for its religious architecture, Oaxaca is full of churches and convents that enclose the colonial history of Mexico and has more than a thousand historical monuments that reflect the evolution of the city. The most important are the Metropolitan Cathedral and the ex-Convent of Santo Domingo, that it contains inside the Museum of Cultures, the Fray Francisco de Burgoa Library and the Ethnobotanical Garden. If you like pre-Hispanic art and culture, we recommend an excursion to one of its archaeological spots, such as Monte Alban or Ocotlan or visit Hierve El Agua, a natural place whose attractions are fossilized waterfalls.Marriott",

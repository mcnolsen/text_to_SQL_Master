Benniksgaard takes its name from a family farm dating all the way back to 1393. Today, Benniksgaard is privately owned and run as a hotel. All the buildings have undergone a comprehensive and painstaking renovation. The rustic style, exposed beams and bright colours create an airy, inviting atmosphere. The old chicken house has been transformed into Restaurant Pejsestuen, the longest wing into a hotel wing with 31 rooms \u2013 and the old farmhouse from 1782 into fourteen stunning spacious rooms and suites. With its squinting walls, sash windows and creaking floors, the listed farmhouse is a constant reminder of bygone times. The first floor staircase is a particularly interesting relic, and indeed, its narrow steps have been a constant feature of the farmhouse. The old grain stores and a recently added wing are home to several function and conference rooms, while the wing formerly occupied by agricultural machinery now houses BenniksgaardButik shop, offering a wide range of items to suit all tastes.bestwestern.com",

It was built in 1968, but in 1984 Britt and Poul J\u00f8rgensen took over, and today they own it together with their two daughters Rikke and Marianne. Rikke is educated in administration and economics, whereas Marianne is a cook and married to the chef of the hotel Tom Thomsen. Over the years the family has made several large renovations, so that today nobody can tell that the oldest parts of the hotel are more than 40 years old. The hotel is situated in the northern part of Vejle and right beside the motorway exit Vejle Nord. Both on the north and the south side of Vejle Fjord the forest-clad hills invite to recreation and nature experiences and along the fjord there are lots of fine walks and the possibility of a swim in the waves. Only ten minutes from the hotel you will find a large deer park with fallow and sika deer and right beside it Skyttehushaven, a large park with a playground for the kids. In Vejle there are cozy pedestrian streets, department stores and a large indoor shopping centre.bestwestern.com",

        "description": "Hotel Phoenix Hjoerring, BW Signature Collection is a really good starting point for experiencing the atmosphere and the sights of the Top of Denmark right from the North Sea to Skagen. Moreover, Hjoerring has a lively shopping milieu with among other things the new and large shopping centre Metropol. The hotel is situated right in the centre of Vendsyssel\u2019s main town Hjoerring, and this has been the case right since the first of May 1887. At that time, it was named W. Kyppers Hotel and with its three stories and fine ornaments of the fa\u00e7ade, it was absolutely the most beautiful building of the town. Later on, it was named Hotel Bristol, for a period it was a temperance hotel, and during World War II the Germans occupied the hotel. After the war the hotel got new owners, and they gave the hotel its present name: Hotel Phoenix. According to the mythology the firebird Phoenix lives for many years before it burns up and resurrects. This is precisely what happened to the hotel: at first it was renovated from top to bottom and later it was extended with a new story. The target of the owner and the skilled staff is to combine the proud historical traditions with the demands and wishes of the present time and of the future and to create a hotel, which gives the guests the optimal experience.bestwestern.com",

This personal boutique hotel is located between Karatinahissen and Gotgatsbacken on Sodermalm, in the middle of the classic silhouette of Slussen. Frantz was inspired by his muse\u2019s and tailored his clients\u2019 garments differently to express who they were, in the same way every guest will be met with care to create a magical and wonderful experience. Judging by the size of the house, Frantz enjoyed surrounding himself with many and different people, of which some real characters that he was both inspired by and dressed as well. This meant that he himself was not only a fashionable man, but also an open-minded person with a sense of touch for the latest. Here you can feel at home, whoever you are and where ever you come from. Frantz\u2019s spirit lives on as we constantly search influences from both the outside world and the local environment in the vision of managing Frantz home. With inspiration from Berlin, New York, the Old Town and Sodermalm, the hotel interior gives a historic yet contemporary feel. Towards Peter Myndes Backe, the doors are open to the new bar and restaurant. Here you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner and don\u2019t forget that you are also always welcome to have a glass of wine at our magic courtyard when you need a break from the rest of Stockholm.bestwestern.com",

And you may well have known that already. Whether you did or not, it is not unreasonable to ask what that has to do with a hotel in Helsingborg, Sweden. Quite a lot, actually, as The Vault Hotel is built on an authentic bank vault from the beginning of the last century. From the time the building itself was a bank. But if you hear a tinkling sound today, it probably is not change being counted \u2013 it is more likely to be ice cubes landing in a glass to chill it for your Manhattan. Welcome to The Vault \u2013 the hotel that is steeped in roots and traditions.

The idea was to recreate the character of Norrt\u00e4lje and the atmosphere of that time. \u00c5tellet offers restaurant, caf\u00e9 and bar services, a sauna, lounges and conference facilities. The guest rooms have an atmosphere inspired by the archipelago. Most rooms have balconies or French balconies and offer wonderful views of the Norrt\u00e4lje Bay. The interiors are inspired by timeless Nordic style with emphasis on comfort and convenience. The furniture has been custom made for \u00c5tellet by a small carpentry in Sm\u00e5land.",

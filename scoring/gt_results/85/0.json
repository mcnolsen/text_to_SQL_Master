The distinctive history and architecture have been meticulously preserved and complemented with modern design and solutions. The Hotel's capacity is a total of 376 guest rooms, including 27 exclusive rooms and suites in the historic Dragon Building. The Hotel also has a new and delicious spa with a pool and a large gym of 1,100 m2. Entrance to Artesia SPA should be booked well in advance of your stay due to limited capacity. Age limit 16 years. Entrance from NOK 195 for staying guests, per visit to the SPA facilities. In our restaurant Holmenkollen BISTRO you can enjoy our unique waffle concept during the day. Waffle fajitas with cheddar and salsa, Club waffle with chicken, or perhaps a waffle with cured ham, sour cream and salad? There are many flavor combinations, and here you can experience the waffle in a way you have never done before. For dinner you can choose from a tasty \u00e0 la carte menu, where the dishes are based on short-traveled Norwegian and Nordic ingredients. Scandic Holmenkollen Park is a destination in itself, a full 350 meters above sea level, with fantastic views over Oslo and the Nordmarka right outside the hotel door. With immediate proximity to the Holmenkollen Skiarena National Complex, the Ski Museum and nature, you will find exciting outdoor activities for everyone. Here you have miles of hiking trails to choose from, and in winter you can go straight out on the WC trails that stretch into Nordmarka. Only minutes away from the hotel is Oslo Winter Park and in the summer you can challenge your fear of heights in one of the Nordic countries' largest climbing parks. The Hotel is only a subway ride away from the center of Oslo, it takes 30 minutes by subway from Oslo Central station to Holmenkollen station.",

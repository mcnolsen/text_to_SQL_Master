        "description": "On the outside, a neoclassical architectural jewel. Inside, a combination of comfort and minimalist aesthetics. A pairing whose fascinating differences make it unpretentiously distinctive. Athens 1890 Hotel & Spa, apart from setting its own tone in the Greek capital\u2019s hospitality, is also the ideal starting point for exploring it: from Eirinis Square, an Athenian corner with its own pulse, it is 300 meters from Monastiraki Square and only a 10-minute walk from Syntagma and Ermou Street, the commercial heart of the city. However, if you decide to spend the day indoors, we have made sure that our facilities and flavors will accompany every moment in an ideal way. From the indoor pool and sauna to the \u00e0 la carte breakfast served in the rooms and the Omnivore restaurant menu, everything is designed to offer more than just a unique hospitality experience: an amalgam of history and stories in the heart of a city where both can be found in abundance. Use of Spa Area All the reservations include a 30\u2019 minutes complimentary entrance (only once) in Spa Area, more specifically for the pool, the sauna and the steam room. Also we provide a -15% discount in massage service, if it is c\u03bfmbined with the complimentary. These services are available upon availability and upon request.",

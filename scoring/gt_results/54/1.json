But it\u2019s inside where things really get interesting. The interior blends handsome woods, plush fabrics, and rich pops of color\u2014and, yes, just a touch of tartan\u2014to luxurious effect. And with a magnetic inner courtyard, an acclaimed Middle Eastern restaurant and award-winning Scottish restaurant, it\u2019s no wonder the hotel has become a natural meeting point.IHG Hotels & Resorts",

From airy public places to each of our 129 smart bedrooms, the mood of Ten Hill Place, is one of quiet sophistication, and one we believe sets us apart from other Edinburgh hotels. We have four fully equipped accessible rooms with an elevator from street level to all floors. This innovative Edinburgh hotel is within easy walking distance of Princes Street, the historic Old Town and the City Centre's main tourist, shopping and business districts; yet peacefully situated away from the main thoroughfares. The best of Edinburgh opens up before you right outside our front door. The Festival Theatre is across the road, the National Museums are around the corner and the Royal Mile, Edinburgh Castle, and Holyrood Palace are just a stone's throw away. Whether on business or a short city break in Edinburgh, make Ten Hill Place your first choice. Edinburgh offers tourist attractions for all ages and interests. Ten Hill Place is owned by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and all profits go back into training surgeons worldwide. Historic and contemporary rooms are available within Surgeons' Hall for conferences, meetings and social events.bestwestern.com",

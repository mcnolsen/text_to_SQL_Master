        "description": "Within a family orientated setting of design-hotels, Saga Hotels comprises of four contrasting concepts dotted throughout Oslo City Centre. Four underlying characteristics of Saga Hotels can be defined by its promise of high standards, trendy interior, exceptional service and relaxing atmosphere. 'Making home feel closer'. The journey of Saga Hotels first began in Frogner, where Saga Hotel Oslo, BW Premier Collection was established. This beautiful setting, rich in heritage, and surrounded by the quaint architecture of Majorstuen was a prosperous beginning to what would eventually expand the family into three new concepts throughout Oslo. Each individual concept focuses on attracting various types of travelers whilst catering to their everyday needs and desires. Our reception area will be renovated from October 16th until March 1st, 2024. This may result in slightly more noise than usual.bestwestern.com",

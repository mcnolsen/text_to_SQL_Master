This beautiful hotel takes its design inspiration from the stories of its neighbourhood. The secret gardens and hidden green spaces of the area come alive in the hotel, across the charming terrace, beautiful courtyard, and rooftop garden as well as spilling into the interior design of the hotel public spaces and bedrooms. Take a stroll out of the hotel and you'll discover the nearby vibrant Naschmarkt, a must see for visitors and the place where locals gather at all times of the day. At night, once the shops close, a selection of unique restaurants and bars, influenced by cuisines from all over the world, come alive. The neighbourhood is also famed for its boutique shops, selling unique products you wouldn't find elsewhere. Situated perfectly for exploring the city, the hotel is within walking distance of the state opera, the \u201cSteffl\u201d (Stephansdom), and the museums and imposing buildings on the Ringstrasse. The hotel is well connected to local transport links and its right next door to the metro station U4 Pilgramgasse, meaning attractions such as the fairy's wheel at Prater and the majestic palace of Schoenbrunn are easy to explore.IHG Hotels & Resorts",

        "description": "\u2018Celebrate Your Life\u2019 the house at Wehlistrasse 153 was once built in 1900 by the master builder Klima. He called it the Reichsbrueckenhof. This name still stands on the facade of the building. As a master builder he was able to use the best and most expensive materials. We benefit from this to this day, as the substance of the house is of outstanding quality. This allowed us to convert any reconstruction work around the former art nouveau residential building, which was decorated with the most splendid art nouveau elements both inside and out, into a modern apartment hotel. Today, arrived in 2019, the Best Western Plus Celebrity Suites shines in new splendor and yet the historic look has been retained. 53 state-of-the-art apartments, both technically and stylistically, make this house, located between the Danube and Vienna's green lung, the Prater, a jewel in the heart of the city. All apartments have fully equipped kitchens and modern bathrooms. The apartments for up to 8 guests can be used for short- or long-term stays. A varied breakfast buffet as well as a bar in the lounge area offering snacks and drinks round off the gastronomic offer. The reception team, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for any inquiries, is looking forward to your visit. Furthermore, guests can clean their laundry in the in-house coin laundry and, of course, the Best Western Plus Celebrity Suites has a professionally equipped fitness room with Technogym equipment. Public transportation such as subway, rapid transit, bus, and airport buses are in the immediate vicinity. If you want to travel by car, you can use our garage in the adjacent building to park your car comfortably.

For this purpose, a beautiful old typical Viennese building from the 1900's was completely rebuilt, while preserving the art nouveau flavor. This results in a striking mix of the 19th and the 21st century. The Best Western Plus Hotel Arcadia offers you 72 rooms, all equipped with mini-bar, air conditioning, room safe, satellite-television, Wi-Fi as well as high-speed cable Internet, and much more. The interior is elegant and comfortable. Many of the changes which were accomplished during the building process have an ecological background. For example, the heating and cooling system is state-of-the-art, reducing our carbon footprint to a sustainable level. For those interested in seminars and conferences, we offer a fully-equipped conference room for up to 30 participants (projector, audio-system, wireless microphone). Feel free to enjoy a nice drink in our lounge or to relax in the courtyard. Located in the heart of the second district of Vienna, it is only a five minute walk to the Prater, a premium spot for jogging, cycling, or to take a walk in the woods. But mostly the Prater is famous for being a huge amusement park, suited for children and adults alike. Vienna\u00b4s largest exhibition center, the Reed Wien Messe, is a ten minute walk from the hotel. Also the historic center is easily reachable, either by underground train, car or other means of transportation. It is only a five minute walk to the Praterstern Station, a major transportation hub (with bus, underground train, tram, and train stops).bestwestern.com",

        "description": "This luxurious 4-star hotel is located right by the beach, and only 400 metres from Magdalena Palace. It is within walking distance of the centre of Santander and the university. Apart from its remarkably good position, the Hotel Hoyuela offers elegant and beautiful design, lots of great facilities and services, and a good restaurant. The rooms are nicely decorated and well-equipped, and some offer a view over the sea.",

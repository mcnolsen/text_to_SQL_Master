        "description": "Historic palazzo on the outside, a bold interpretation of luxury inside, W Rome celebrates the Italian attitude and captures the energy of the Eternal City. With its 162 rooms and suites, design twist and vibrant experiences, the hotel marks the W Hotels entry to the scene in an unapologetically Italian way, starting from the taste experiences with Head chef Ciccio Sultano who shakes up the city's foodie scene with authentic Sicilian cooking served at Giano Restaurant. Loaded with Roman vitality yet dismantling the norm, W Rome has something for everyone, whether it be a sweet retreat at Zucchero x Fabrizio Fiorani, a cocktail with upbeat music at W Lounge or live entertainment at Giardino Clandestino. On the upper floor, striking views of the city make Seu Pizza con Vista, in collaboration with Pier Daniele Seu, and WET Deck even more exceptional. Owning the Eternal City mindset, W Rome calls out the past, present and future to remix tradition and defy boundaries.Marriott",

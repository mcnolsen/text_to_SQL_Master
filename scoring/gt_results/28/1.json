Esteemed neighbours aside, this former boarding school has been transformed into a small-scale hotel with just 18 rooms. Several of them overlook the Palazzo\u2019s secret gardens; nab one with a furnished terrace suspended over them. The all-day bar extends out to the courtyard in fine weather, and you don\u2019t have to wait for the bell to ring for the fun to start (first orders are taken at 10.30am). Don\u2019t be fooled by the bistro\u2019s Adelaide moniker: there\u2019s nothing Antipodean about this seasonal Roman fare.Mr & Mrs Smith",

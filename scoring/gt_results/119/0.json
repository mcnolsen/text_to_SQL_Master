        "description": "What better way to spend time in Boston during this time than on your own private yacht. Come social distance on your own private yacht! Your yacht will be cleaned and disinfected in between stays. All linens are changed and disinfected between stays. The Green Turtle II is a 45 foot motor yacht. Set in the historic Boston/Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston Harbor, the Green Turtle II offers an expansive view of Boston. The Green Turtle II is permanently docked at a protected marina during your stay. The USS Constitution, Bunker Hill Monument and the Freedom Trail are just a short walk away. Take the free bus shuttle to North Station(.07 miles away) to the subway to any of the sites. Enjoy the privacy of your own yacht. The Green Turtle was designed for comfort above all and the only reminder you are floating in Boston Harbor is the sound of the gulls, motion of the sea and reflection of the ocean dancing on the ceiling. Enjoy the outdoors on the comfortable aft deck watching the harbor traffic. The Green Turtle II can accommodate 2-6 people. She has 2 queen staterooms and the salon has a sleeper sofa for 2 along with comfortable seating. There is a dinette and galley along with a fantastic aft deck with comfortable outdoor seating area with spectacular views. She is heated and air conditioned. We will meet you on the pier and bring you to the boat and orient you to the boat and how to get around. We will also make recommendations. Come Float With US!Expedia",
